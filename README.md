# To-Do List Assignment

## Objective

Implement the JavaScript logic to enable adding and deleting tasks in a to-do list. You will be working with the provided HTML and CSS structure.

## Files Provided

- **index.html**: The HTML structure for the to-do list.
- **styles.css**: The CSS styles for the to-do list.
- **scripts.js**: The JavaScript file where you will write your logic.

## Tasks to Implement:

### Add a New Task:

- When the "Add Task" button is clicked, the task entered in the input field should be added to the to-do list.
- Each task should be added as a new list item within the unordered list.
- The input field should be cleared after the task is added.
- Each new task should have a "Delete" button next to it and a checkbox to mark it as completed.

### Delete a Task:

- When the "Delete" button next to a task is clicked, that task should be removed from the to-do list.

### Mark a Task as Completed:

- When a task checkbox is checked, the task should be marked as completed (e.g., by applying a strikethrough style to the text).
- When the checkbox is unchecked, the task should be marked as not completed (remove the strikethrough style).
